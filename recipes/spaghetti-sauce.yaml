title: Spaghetti Sauce

description:
  A mash-up of various internet recipes and the Whole30.com recipe. So
  delicious I’ve been eating it like soup. The carrots provide the
  sweetness.

ingredients:
  - name: olive oil
    amount: 1
    unit: tablespoons

  - name: onion
    amount: 1

  - name: celery
    amount: 2
    unit: stalks

  - name: carrots
    amount: 2

  - name: minced garlic
    amount: 2
    unit: cloves

  - name: "fresh herbs—whatever you have, eg: basil, oregano, tarragon,
      thyme, rosemary"
    amount: 1
    unit: sprigs

  - name: peppers (hot or sweet)
    amount: 5

  - name: crushed tomatoes
    amount: 16
    unit: ounces

directions:
  - Slice, chop, and mince onions, celery, carrot, garlic, and herbs
  - Sauté everything except for the tomatoes
  - Dump in tomatoes into an Instant-Pot
  - Hit Manual for 15 minutes with pressure seal closed
  - Let pressure release naturally
  - Blend with a stick blender in pot, or in a blender or food processor
  - Note that you can also do this without an instant pot. Just simmer over
    low heat for about an hour, stirring every 15 minutes.
  - Note that you can also freeze this, or dehydrate it (for backpacking)
